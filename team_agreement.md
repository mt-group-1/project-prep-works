This workflow employs two parallel long-running branches:

used for releases only
- **Develop**
created from Master, this is the home of all completed and stable features prepared for the next release

When you start working on a new feature, create a new `Feature` branch from `Develop`. Create as many feature branches in parallel as you want and need. When the work is done and the feature is tested, merge the code back to `Develop`.
